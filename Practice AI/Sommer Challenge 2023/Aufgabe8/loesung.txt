drobor:
here's how my solution worked:
||you can determine whether you hit a finish if you change single move at a constant time
for each move: 
  try to replace it with every other possible move and figure if you could hit finish if there were no obstacles
  simulate remaining path to the finish\\obstacle hit. If you hit obstacle remember whole path in HashSet as "leading to obstacle"||
